#hapiblog

Our objective for our 8th week here at Founders & Coders is to create a blog using the framework Hapi.js.

------

##Getting Started

Why not give our blog a go yourself? First things first:

* Clone our repo using ```git clone https://github.com/codependentfc/hapiblog.git```

* In order to install all of the dependencies, run ```npm install```

* To get ```localhost:8080``` running in your browser, enter ```node app``` into your terminal.

...and voil√†!

It **should** be up and running
